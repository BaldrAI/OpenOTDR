# OpenOTDR
OpenOTDR is an Open Source OTDR reporting tool.

It takes raw OTDR traces as .SOR files, detects and classifies features on the trace, and generates reports.


You may need `pyqt5-dev-tools` package if you edit the ui file
then you will need to run `pyuic5 -x mainwindow.ui -o mainwindow.py`
